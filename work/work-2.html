<h4 class='work-title'>Movico - Operation Coordinator</h4>

<p>My biggest adventures in life were 6 years at this company. Driving thru Europe for sport events and roadshows (B2B & B2C). My job was to transport mobile facilities (40T kg) with a maximum set-up time of 4 hours. Ideal for sport events such as the Tour d'France, Giro d'Italia and even the Dakar rally on the South American continent. With a hydraulic expandable trailer that transformed in no time to a 3 stock high building with 150 square meters we deserved our nickname 'The Transformers'.</p>
<p>Projects lasted from 1 - 4 weeks (max. 7 weeks on the road) so transport and building trucks on location weren't the only responsibilities I had.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Customer contact on location</strong> was one of the first things I did when I arrived. 
	<ul>
		<li>Communication, mostly in a foreign language</li>
		<li>Inquire locations and ETA.</li>
		<li>Advise locations <em>e.g. does the invitee has a good view of the finishing line?</em></li>
		<li>Costumer relations; dining together, share a hotel or flight.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	A bumpy road isn't a best friend of sensitive technical equipment. So <strong>solve technical problems</strong> and get your hands dirty.
	<ul>
		<li>Hydraulic failures</li>
		<li>Replace flat tires</li>
		<li>Clogged toilet</li>
		<li>Failing airconditioning</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Facility management</strong> was an important service. Trucks get dirty on the road and during operational hours things might get out of stock. Or what if those cute promotion girls arrived too late? There must be coffee!
	<ul>
		<li>Vacuum cleaning</li>
		<li>Window cleaning</li>
		<li>Promotional activities</li>
		<li>Replacing garbage bags</li>
		<li>Serving coffee or tea</li>
		<li>Maintain water supply</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	There is even more! Most of the time I led a team of freelancers. And since I was a permanent employee of the company that made me the <strong>project leader</strong> on site. 
</p>
<p>
	Every project comes with <strong>administration</strong>. 
	In preparation for the project I had to:
	<ul>
		<li>Make a roadbook <em>e.g. do I have to take a ferry? Can I drive the truck over the mountain?</em></li>
		<li>Book hotels <em>e.g. can I park my truck near the hotel?</em></li>
		<li>Check inventory and collect the furniture in our warehouse</li>
	</ul>
<p>
	The last thing to do after a project was to do more <strong>administration</strong>:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Declare receipts <em>e.g. toll roads, visiting restaurants, hotel accommodations, credit card or cash?</em></li>
		<li>Write a project evaluation <em>e.g. what are the recommendations for next year? Was the costumer satisfied?</em></li>
		<li>Fill in a timesheet</li>
	</ul>	
</p>
<p>
	And last but not least I was a member of the <strong>innovation team</strong>.
