<h4 class='work-title'>Webdevelopment</h4>

<strong>Introduction</strong>
<p>As a beginning webdeveloper. I started learning myself HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. In the near future I want to expand my knowledge and learn PHP and MySQL as well. As I m not a designer, I see my future as a back-end developer.</p>
<strong>History</strong>
<p>This is the first website I've made in over 10 years. I've studied IT when I came from high school and made some websites in the early 2000's. But I wanted to go for adventure instead of sitting in an office all day. As a truck driver I've seen 90% of Europe and even drove my truck in South America. But now it's time to get serious in life...</p>
<strong>This website</strong>
<p>I made this website with Jekyll and wrote most of it in HTML and SASS.</p>
